## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.8] - 2022-10-6
### Added
- forced molecule name in Loader with *molecule* keyword
### Changed
- increased loading performance for Dace data
### Fixed
- ascii conversion for strings in ExoMol data

## [1.0.5] - 2021-05-11
### Added
- support for DACE opacities original data

## [1.0.4] - 2021-05-04
### Added
- added Rayleigh scattering converter. This class computes the Rayleigh scattering for the indicated atom and can be used as input data for the RAPOC models.
### Changed
- we removed "cubic" mode and added "loglinear" instead. This mode is the same as "linear" but uses the logarithm of pressure instead of simple pressure.
- we added ``self.exceptions`` variable to model. If it is not `None`, ``model.estimate`` and the validation procedures behave accordingly. The variable is given by the ``loader.read_content`` and is ``None`` by default.
- _ktable_ name replaced with _opacities_

## [1.0.0] - 2021-03-02
First RAPOC release
